Frogger-Classic-Arcade-game
===============================


This game was made to practice Object-Oriented JavaScript which is a part of a course in the Udacity Front-End Web Nanodegree program. Used Object object oriented javascript principles, HTML and CSS to create this game. 

*** HOW TO RUN ***

To start the game you must run the index.html file in a browser.

*** HOW TO PLAY ***

The game uses keyboard arrows. Players must use the keyboard arrows (up, down, right, left) to navigate the character around the board.

The objective of the game is to always avoid enemy (bug) collisions.

If the player collides with the enemy, the game will reset the character to the start position of the board.

The player wins the game if there are no enemy collisions, allowing the character to reach the blue water at the top of the board.
